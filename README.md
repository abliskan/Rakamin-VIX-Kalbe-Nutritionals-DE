#  Final Project Data Engineer | Rakamin Academy x Kalbe Nutritionals
## Overview
Virtual Internship Experience (VIX) Program is an overview of how a Data Engineer works at Kimia Farma in collaboration with Rakamin Academy. The final project is given to provide a challenge to prospective data engineers to implement all the knowledge related to Data Engineering that has been mastered previously.

## Project
Data Warehouse and ETL Implementation are important topics in the world of data analysis. In this assignment, participants will learn the definition and purpose of each ETL stage in Pentaho and Airflow. In addition, participants will learn to implement the ETL process in Pentaho and Airflow, as well as integrate GCP with these two tools to support the ETL process effectively. In certain business cases, participants will learn to apply ETL tools to customer data cases, which include data such as demographics, purchase history, and customer preferences. Participants will be expected to be able to create jobs in Pentaho and DAG in Airflow which consists of several ETL stages. Apart from that, participants are also expected to be able to carry out the SQL querying process up to the evaluation stage. All material will be tested to ensure participant understanding.
